# Places Tour Site

This is a web application built with JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. The project allows users to select and manage places they would like to visit. It's my own implementation of a project initially developed by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

## Future Plans

As I continue to learn, I plan to refactor the local storage functionality using a custom hook in the future.
